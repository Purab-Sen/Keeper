# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


About Project:

If you want to run it on your local machine:
use the following command in terminal:
"npm run dev"

In response you will get a link, click on it by pressing on ctrl key if you are using vscode.It will take you to your default browser and will run the project in new tab.
